# Phase-lead and phase-lag compensator by Bode and root locus

The first part is the design of a phase-lead compensator using the Bode analysis in the frequency domain. The second part is the design of a phase-lead compensator, and a phase-lag compensator in series with the first phase-lead compensator using two different approaches of root locus methods.
